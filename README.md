### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nic `Nico` Desjardins.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Programming C# applications / functionality for a private client
- Myself (as a person, father, partner, lover, programmer, artist, human, etc)
- An app for my girlfriend to convert all her non-mp3s to mp3s... because her little mp3 player only plays mp3s and she has a bunch of non-mp3s {https://github.com/nicdesjardins/convertFolderOfMusicToMp3}

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- To hone my craft as a programmer... Robert `uncle bob` C. Martin's videos and books have re-invigorated my thirst for bettering myself as a craftsman.
  - ++ I've also started looking into other folks talking about how to improve on the craft/art/etc of making applications.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an open source project. I'm thinking @hovancik's project https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly because I use it all the time and I have some ideas for improvements that I could make use of in my own life.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, really!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at letschat@nicdesjardins.com

âš¡ Fun facts:
- I try to go on as many adventures as possible, be they physical or psychological.
- I practice yoga, and not just asana :>
- I love foraging, growing, and harvesting as much as my own food as possible.
- I love photography, painting, and drawing to lose myself in the beauty of life.
- I acknowledge that humans are not the only ones on earth and the other-than-humans deserve our respect.
- I'm a hippie stay-at-home working dad. { if you can't tell I'm a hippie, re-read above }
