### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nic `Nico` Desjardins.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Programming C# applications / functionality for a private client
- Myself (as a person, father, partner, lover, programmer, artist, human, etc)
- An app for my girlfriend to convert all her non-mp3s to mp3s... because her little mp3 player only plays mp3s and she has a bunch of non-mp3s {https://github.com/nicdesjardins/convertFolderOfMusicToMp3}

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- To hone my craft as a programmer... I've recently gotten incredibly inspired by Robert `uncle bob` C. Martin's videos and books. { I suggest you look him up on youtube. Start with: The Scribe's Oath â€¢ Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin }
  - ++ I'm trying my best to adhere to the [Programmer's Oath](http://nicdesjardins.com/documents/The_Programmers_Oath)
- To teach a subject while learning it. Just gotta stay one day ahead :D

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an an open source project. I'm thinking @hovancik's project https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly because I use it all the time and I have some ideas for improvements that I could make use of in my own life.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
- Paying my bills { see directly below for clarification }:
  - If I could afford to work more often on open source projects than not, I would feel better about how I spend my time on this planet.
  - I guess I'm looking for help to transition to coding the things I want to code, rather than what some client wants. I want to pick my projects, write good code, help people out, and get paid for it.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, really!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: send an email to letschat@nicdesjardins.com (I've abandonned instagram, facebook, and twitter).

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Hey! You there! Sir! Dude! Silly Fucker! Bruh! He/him! Sire! {I'm mostly kidding, but not really, call me what you like and use your best judgement. We can have a conversation. }

âš¡ Fun facts:
- I try to go on as many adventures as possible, be they physical or psychological.
- I practice yoga, and not just asana :>
- I love foraging, growing, and harvesting as much as my own food as possible.
- I love photography, painting, and drawing to lose myself in the beauty of life.
- I acknowledge that humans are not the only ones on earth and the other-than-humans deserve our respect.
- I'm a hippie stay-at-home working dad. { if you can't tell I'm a hippie, re-read above }
